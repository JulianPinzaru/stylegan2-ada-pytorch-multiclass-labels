# Creating your labels dataset.json file for multiclass training.
### You have to put that file under your folder with processed images generated by dataset_tool.py

**Usage example:**  
```
python make_json_labels.py --input_folder=/path-to-stylegan/multiclass-images-directory \
 --output_folder=/path-to-stylegan/path-to-output-dataset
```
